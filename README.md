A calorie and weight logger I made for my personal gymventures.

Not meant to be used seriously - use an online service, or something (no, seriously, I made this in half an hour).

### Arguments
- `help` -> duh.
- `log {calories} [weight (kg)]` -> associates the current date and time with the calorie count and weight provided.
- `read` -> displays all past data in a pretty format.
- `reset` -> resets all data

### Install
If you're on *nix (preferably Linux) you can `chmod +x` and run the `install.sh` script.

If you're on Windows, you will have to just use a normal directory somewhere in your `Documents`.
